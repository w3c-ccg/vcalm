# [VC API](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-api/) Goals

The W3C CCG VC APIs are a set of RESTful API definitions conforming with the
[OpenAPI 3.0 Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) (formerly known
as Swagger) for the roles of Issuer, Verifier, and Holder as described in the
[Verifiable Credential Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)
specification.  These APIs provide a standard set of interfaces by which
interoperability may be tested and verified by various parties who leverage
Verifiable Credentials (VCs).

Current versions of the APIs are --
* [Issuer](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/issuer.html)
* [Holder](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/holder.html)
* [Verifier](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/verifier.html)

As some implementations may not support all endpoints defined by this
specification, the APIs provide a clean measure by which to identify which
methods are or are not implemented when comparing solutions that provide VC
support across vendors.

Test procedures and specifications are provided as part of this API definition
to allow for repeatable and automated interoperability testing between solutions
that interact with Verifiable Credentials.

## Style, Versioning, and Contribution
This API is versioned in conformance with the [Semantic Versioning 2.0
specification](https://semver.org/) to prevent breaking changes between minor
versions, and to allow for reliable testing and integration of implementations
of this API within enterprise environments.

API style, endpoint naming, and object definitions within the vc-api should be
in compliance with the guidelines laid out in the [REST API
Tutorial](https://restfulapi.net/).  The VC API conforms primarily to the
[controller](https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/) model as detailed in the
REST documentation.

The actual standard and specification defined by the vc-api is provided in YAML
format and should be referenced directly by developers should questions arise,
as certain interfaces on top of OpenAPI specifications may differ in their
presentation of certain scenarios commonly encountered in API definitions,
especially when dealling with `nullable` parameters or properties.

Contributions to this repo should take place via a Pull Request, and should
generally reference an issue and related discussion around the topic 

## Best Practices

### Security

Implementations of this API SHOULD NOT be exposed directly over http(s) without
authorization.  Best Practices around OAuth and other widely accepted standards
for authentication and/or authorization should be followed.

### Holder APIs 

Holder APIs are optional as many implementations will not need them, however
they are extremely useful for testing purposes as well as for cases where WebKMS
is not present or not an option.

## Public Meetings

The editors host an open community call using W3C-CCG meeting infrastructure.
This entails:
- Proposed agendas and supplemental materials for review are sent out by any
  regularly-participating member to the [CCG mailing
  list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/); editors and
  CCG chairs reserve the right to  adjudicate if conflicting, inappropriate, or
  contentious agenda proposals are put forward.
- Mostly-audio calls hosted on a CCG [Jitsi
  room](https://meet.w3c-ccg.org/vcapi), Tuesdays at 4pm Eastern Time. This
  allows members to screenshare during issue review or discussion of diagrams.
- Minutes are scribed by volunteers from the group and sent to the CCG mailing
  list for review.

### Development

To assemble bundled yamls, as well as an all-in-one bundle of all definitions
run the following:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the following files:

- `api/vc-api.yaml` - a bundle with all specifications rolled into one
- `api/bundles/issuer.yml` - issuer endpoints bundled with no external refs
- `api/bundles/verifier.yml` - verifier endpoints bundled with no external refs
- `api/bundles/holder.yml` - holder endpoints bundled with no external refs
