    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
The Verifiable Credentials specification [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]] provides a data
model and serialization to express digital credentials in a way that is
cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable. This
specification provides a set of HTTP Application Programming Interfaces (HTTP
APIs) and protocols for issuing, verifying, presenting, and managing Verifiable
Credentials.
    </p>

    <p>
When managing <a>verifiable credentials</a>, there are two general types of APIs
that are contemplated. The first type of APIs are designed to be used within
a single security domain. The second type of APIs can be used to
communicate across different security domains. This specification defines
both types of APIs.
    </p>

    <p>
The APIs that are designed to be used within a single security domain are used by
systems that are operating on behalf of a single role such as an Issuer, Verifier,
or Holder. One benefit of these APIs for the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem
is that they define a useful, common, and vetted modular architecture for
managing Verifiable Credentials. For example, this approach helps software
architects integrate with common components and speak a common language
when implementing systems that issue <a>verifiable credentials</a>. Knowing that
a particular architecture has been vetted is also beneficial for architects that
do not specialize in <a>verifiable credentials</a>. Documented architectures and
APIs increase market competition and reduce vendor lock-in and switching
costs.
    </p>

    <p>
The APIs that are designed to operate across multiple security domains are
used by systems that are communicating between two different roles in a
<a>verifiable credential</a> interaction, such as an API that is used to
communicate presentations between a Holder and a Verifier. In order to
achieve protocol interoperability in <a>verifiable credentials</a> interactions,
it is vital that these APIs be standardized. The additional benefits of
documenting these APIs are the same for documenting the
single-security-domain APIs: common, vetted architecture and APIs, increased
market competition, and reduced vendor lock-in and switching costs.
    </p>

    <p>
This specification contains the following sections that software architects
and implementers might find useful:

      </li>
      <li>
<a href="#verifying"></a> specifies the APIs for verifying both
<a>verifiable credentials</a> and verifiable presentations.
      </li>
      <li>
<a href="#presenting"></a> defines APIs for generating and deriving
<a>verifiable presentations</a> within a trust domain, as well as
exchanging <a>verifiable presentations</a> across trust domains.
      </li>
      <li>
Finally, Appendix <a href="#privacy-considerations"></a>, and
<a href="#security-considerations"></a> are provided to highlight factors
that implementers might consider when building systems that utilize the APIs
defined by this specification.

      <h2>
Architecture Overview
      </h2>

      <p>
The Verifiable Credentials Data Model defines three fundamental roles, the Issuer, the Verifier, and the Holder.
      </p>

      <figure id="roles">
        <img style="margin: auto; height: 25%; display: block;"
       src="./diagrams/roles.svg"
       alt="

        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
The roles defined by the Verifiable Credentials Data Model specification.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
Actors fulfilling each of these roles may use a number of
software or service components to realize the VC API for
exchanging Verifiable Credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
Each role associates with a role-specific Coordinator, Service, and Admin as well
as their own dedicated Storage Service. In addition, the Issuer  may
also manage a Status Service for revocable credentials issued by the Issuer.
      </p>

      <figure id="components">
        <img style="margin: auto; width: 100%; display: block;"
       src="diagrams/components.svg"
       alt="VC API Components of Coordinators, Services, and Admin for Issuers, Verifiers, and Holders">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
VC API Components. Arrows indicate initiation of flows.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
Any given VC API implementation may choose to combine any or all of these
components into a single functional application. The boundaries and
interfaces between these components are defined in this specification to
ensure interoperability and substitutability across the Verifiable
Credential conformant ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
In addition to aggregating components into a single app, implementers
may choose to operationalize any given role over any number active
instances of deployed software. For example, a browser-based Holder Coordinator
should be considered as an amalgam of a web browser, various code running
in that browser, one or more web servers (in the case of cross-origin AJAX
or remote embedded content), and the code running on that server. Each of
those elements runs as different software packages in different
configurations, each executing just part of the overall functionality of
the component. For the sake of the VC API, each component satisfies all of
its required functionality as a whole, regardless of deployment
architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
We define these components as follows:
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Coordinators</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Issuer Coordinator &bull; Verifier Coordinator &bull; Holder Coordinator </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
Coordinators execute the business rules and policies set by the associated role.
Often this is a custom or proprietary Coordinator developed specifically for a
single party acting in that role, it is the integration glue that connects
the controlling party to the VC ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
Coordinators may or may not provide a visual user interface, depending on the
implementation. Pure command-line or continuously running services may
also be able to realize this component.
        </p>
        <p>
With the exception of the Status Service, all role-to-role communication
is between Coordinators acting on behalf of its particular actor to fulfill its
role.
        </p>
        <p>
The Issuer Coordinator executes the rules about who gets what credentials,
including how the parties creating or receiving those credentials are
authenticated and authorized. Typically the Issuer Coordinator integrates the
Issuer's back-end system with the Issuer service. This integration uses
whatever technologies are Appropriate; the interfaces between the Issuer
App and back-end services are out of scope for the VC-API.  The Issuer Coordinator
drives the Issuer service.
        </p>
        <p>
The Verifier Coordinator communicates with a Verifier service to first check
authenticity and timeliness of a given VC or VP, then Applies the
Verifier's business rules before ultimately accepting or rejecting that VC
or VP. Such business rules may include evaluating the Issuer of a
particular claim or simply checking a configured allow-list. The Verifier
App exposes an API for submitting VCs to the Verifier per the Verifier's
policies. For example, the Verifier Coordinator may only accept VCs from current
users of the Verifier's other services. These rules typically require
bespoke integration with the Verifier's existing back-end.
        </p>
        <p>
The Holder Coordinator executes the business rules for Approving the flow of
credentials under the control of the Holder, from Issuers to Verifiers. In
several deployments this means exposing a user interface that gives
individual Holders a visual way to authorize or Approve VC storage or
transfer. Some functionality of the Holder Coordinator is commonly referred to as
a wallet. In the VC API, the Holder Coordinator initiates all flows. They request
VCs from Issuers. They decide if, and when, to share those VCs with
Verifiers. Within the VC API, there is no way for either the Issuer or the
Verifier to initiate a VC transfer. In many scenarios, the Holder Coordinator is
expected to be under the control of an individual human, ensuring a person
is directly involved in the communication of VCs, even if only at the step
of authorizing the transfer. However, many VCs are about organizations,
not individuals. How individuals using Holder Coordinators related to
organizations, and in particular, how organizational credentials are
securely shared with, and presented by, (legal) agents of those
organizations is not yet specified as in scope for the VC API.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Services</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Issuer Service &bull; Verifier Service &bull; Holder Service </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
Services provide generic VC API functionality, driven by its associated
App. Designed to enable infrastructure providers to offer VC capability
through Software-as-a-Service. All services expose network endpoints to
their authorized Coordinators, which are themselves operating on behalf of the
associated role. Although deployed services MAY provide their own HTML
interfaces, such interfaces are out of scope for the VC API. Only the
network endpoints of services are defined herein.
        </p>
        <p>
The Issuer Service takes requests to issue VCs from authorized Issuer Coordinators
and returns well-formed, signed Verifiable Credentials. This service MUST
have access to private keys (or key services which utilize private keys)
in order to create the proofs for those VCs. The API between the Issuer
service and its associated key service is believed to be out of scope for
the VC API, but may be addressed by WebKMS or similar specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
The Verifier service takes requests to verify Verifiable Credentials and
Verifiable Presentations and returns the result of checking their proofs
and status (if present). The service only checks the authenticity and
timeliness of the VC; leaving the Verifier Coordinator to finish Applying any business rules needed.
        </p>
        <p>
  The Holder service takes requests to create Verifiable Presentations
  from an optional set of VCs and returns well-formed, signed Verifiable
  Presentations containing those VCs. These VPs are used with Issuers to
  demonstrate control over DIDs prior to issuance and with Verifiers to
  present specific VCs.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Status Service</h3>
        <p>
        The Status Service provides a privacy-preserving means for publishing
        and checking the status of any Verifiable Credentials issued by the
        Issuer. Verifier services use the Issuer's status endpoint (as
        specified in each revocable verifiable credential) to check the
        timeliness of a given VC as part of verification.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Storage Services</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Storage Service (Issuer) &bull;Storage Service
            (Verifier) &bull; Storage Service (Holder)
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
Each actor in the system is expected to store their own verifiable
credentials, as needed. Several known implementations use secure data
storage such as encrypted data vaults for storing the Holder's VCs and
use cryptographic authorizations to grant access to those VCs to
Verifier Coordinators, as directed by the Holder. In-browser retrieval of such
stored credentials can enable web-based Verifier Coordinators to integrate
data from the Holder without sharing that data with the Verifier—the
data is only ever present in the browser. Authorizing third-party
remote access to Holder storage is likely in-scope for the VC API,
although we expect this to be defined using extensible mechanisms to
support a variety of storage and authorization approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
The Issuer and Verifier storage solutions may or may not use secure
data storage. Since all such storage interaction is moderated by the
bespoke Issuer and Storage Coordinators, any necessary integrations can simply
be part of that bespoke customization. We expect different
implementations to compete on the ease of integration into various
back-end storage platforms.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Admin</h3>
        <p><strong>Issuer Admin &bull; Holder Admin &bull; Verifier Admin</strong></p>
        <p>
The Admin component is an acknowledgement that each of the other
components need a way to be configured and managed, without
prescribing the interfaces or means of that configuration. Some components
may use JSON files to drive a semi-automated Issuer. Others might
expose HTML pages. We expect different Coordinators and Services to compete on
the power, ease, and flexibility of their administration and
therefore, as of this writing, we anticipate Admin functionality to be
out of scope for the VC API. However, we actually believe that to the
extent we can standardize configuration setting across
implementations, the more substitutable each component.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
Based on this architectural thinking, we may want to frame the VC API
as a roadmap of related specifications, integrated in an extensible
way for maximum substitutability. Several technologies, such as EDVs
and WebKMSs would likely benefit from the crypto suite Approach taken
for VC proofs. Defining a generic mechanism that can be realized by
any functionally conformant technology enables flexibility while
laying the groundwork with current existing functionality. In this
way, we may be able to acknowledge that elements like Key Services,
Storage, and Status are necessary parts of the VC API while deferring
the definition of how those elements work to specification already in
development as well as those yet to be written.

    <h2>The VC API</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Authorization</h3>
      <p>
The VC API can be deployed in a variety of networking environments which
might contain hostile actors. As a result, conforming <a>VC API servers</a>
require conforming <a>VC API clients</a> to utilize secure authorization
technologies when performing certain types of requests. Each HTTP endpoint
defined in this document specifies whether or not authorization is required
when performing a request.
      </p>
      <p>
This section details the authorization technologies that have been contemplated
for use by conforming implementations. Other equivalent authorization
technologies can be used. Implementers are cautioned against using non-standard
or legacy authorization technologies.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h4>Forbidden Authorization</h4>
        <p>
Requests to the VC API MUST NOT utilize any authorization protocol that
includes long-lived static credentials such as usernames and passwords or
similar values in those requests. An example of such a forbidden protocol is
HTTP Basic Authentication [[RFC7617]].
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>OAuth 2.0</h4>
        <p>
If the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [[RFC6749]] is utilized for authorization,
the access tokens utilized by clients MAY be OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens [[RFC6750]]
or any other valid OAuth 2.0 token type. Any valid OAuth 2.0 grant type MAY be used
to request the access tokens.

The URL path values <code>exchange-id</code> and <code>transaction-id</code> are
meaningful to the server but are opaque to the client. While some server
implementations might use values that happen to be human-readable,  clients are
strongly advised to not assign semantics to any human-readable values.

        <h4>Exchange Examples</h4>

        <p>
The APIs in this specification enables unmediated (automated,
machine-to-machine) or mediated (person in the loop) exchanges to be
executed. These exchanges are initiated by a Holder Coordinator and responded to by
any Coordinator that implements exchanges. The flows consist of the following steps:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
The Holder Coordinator contacts the receiving Coordinator to request the initiation of a
particular exchange.
          </li>
          <li>
The receiving Coordinator responds with a presentation request of some kind to
authenticate and/or authorize the Holder Coordinator and provides the next hop in the
exchange as a URL.
          </li>
          <li>
The Holder Coordinator responds to the receiving Coordinator with a Verifiable Presentation
containing information that will satisfy the presentation request.
          </li>
          <li>
The receiving Coordinator responds with a Verifiable Presentation with the newly issued
Verifiable Credentials or a further presentation request as expressed in
step 2 above.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
The Holder Coordinator MAY call the Coordinator's exchange discovery endpoint to determine if
the Holder Coordinator supports the Coordinator's protocol requirements on a particular endpoint,
before actually initiating the exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
A diagram of the steps outlined above is presented below:

        <p class="note">
The general exchange above can be performed in a way that is fully automated,
mediated by a person, or in a hybrid fashion where portions are automated
but interaction by a person is required at certain stages. The second step
above is used to provide guidance on whether the next step is automated or
requires an individual to intervene.
        </p>

        <p>
The following example demonstrates a fully automated flow for performing a
Verifiable Credential refresh that follows the generic flow mentioned above:

Readers are urged to pay particular attention to the `interact` service

While the example above utilizes a Verifiable Presentation Request, other types
of equivalent presentation request formats, such as WACI/PeX, can be utilized
(simultaneously or alternatively) based on the presentation request formats that
are supported by the Issuer. Automated requests can be signalled by setting  the
service `type` to `UnmediatedPresentationService2021`, while manual  requests
can be signalled by setting the service `type` to
`MediatedPresentationService2021`.

      <h3>Phone Home Considered Harmful</h3>

      <p>
It is considered a bad practice for a <a>verifier</a> to contact an
<a>issuer</a> about a specific <a>verifiable credential</a>. This 
practice is known as "phoning home" and can result in a mismatch 
in privacy expectations for the <a>holder</a> as it allows the 
<a>issuer</a> to correlate the <a>holder</a> without their knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
Sometimes an issuer can be contacted to get status information in a 
privacy-respecting manner, such as through a status list that provides 
herd privacy. This is ok as long as the issuer is not able to correlate 
a single individual based on the retrieval of the status list.
      </p>

      <p>
<a>Verifiers</a> are urged to not "phone home" in ways that will create 
a privacy violation on a specific individual.
