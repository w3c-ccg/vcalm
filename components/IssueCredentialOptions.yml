    IssueCredentialOptions:

      description: Options for specifying how the DataIntegrityProof is created.
      properties:
        created:
          type: string
          description: The date and time of the proof (with a maximum accuracy in seconds). Defaults to current system time.
        challenge:
          type: string
          description: A challenge provided by the party requesting the proof. For example, 6e62f66e-67de-11eb-b490-ef3eeefa55f2
        domain:
          type: string
          description: The intended domain of validity for the proof. For example, website.example
        mandatoryPointers:
          type: array
          description: Used with selective disclosure schemes to specify mandatory reveal statements
        credentialId:
          type: string
          description: >
            A URI that can be used to identify the credential, that can be used in APIs
            to refer to the issued verifiable credential. If credentialId is not
            provided by the issuer coordinator, the issuer service will auto-populate
            its value from credential.id. If neither credentialId nor credential.id is
            provided, it will not be possible to refer to this credential once issued
            nor to deal with errors of duplication. credentialId SHOULD NOT be set by
            the issuer coordinator if the credential.id property is set, nor should
            credentialId be used as a replacement for credential.id; rather,
            credentialId is a means of identifying a credential without the id property
            (i.e., credential.id) being set. The issuer service SHOULD NOT
            auto-generate a credentialId if one is not supplied by the issuer
            coordinator, because doing so could create a partitioning error if the
            result is never received by the client.
      example:
        {
          "created": "2020-04-02T18:48:36Z",
          "credentialStatus": { "type": "RevocationList2020Status" },
        }
