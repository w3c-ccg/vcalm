    IssueCredentialOptions:

      additionalProperties: false
      description: Options for specifying how the DataIntegrityProof is created.
      properties:
        created:
          type: string
          description: The date and time of the proof (with a maximum accuracy in seconds). Default current system time.
        challenge:
          type: string
          description: A challenge provided by the requesting party of the proof. For example 6e62f66e-67de-11eb-b490-ef3eeefa55f2
        domain:
          type: string
          description: The intended domain of validity for the proof. For example website.example
        credentialStatus:
          type: object
          description: The method of credential status to issue the credential including. If omitted credential status will be included.
          properties:
            type:
              type: string
              description: The type of credential status to issue the credential with
        credentialId:
          type: string
          description: An identifier that can be used to identify the credential. credentialId SHOULD NOT be set if the id property is set. If credential.id is set, that value will be duplicated for credentialId. If neither credentialId nor id is set, there will be no way to uniquely identify a credential or deal with duplicate errors. This property should not be used as a replacement for credential.id, rather as a means of identifying a credential without the id property set.
      example:
        {
          "created": "2020-04-02T18:48:36Z",
          "credentialStatus": { "type": "RevocationList2020Status" },
        }
