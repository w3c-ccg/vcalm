    VerifyPresentationOptions:
      type: object
      additionalProperties: true
      description: Options for specifying how a presentation is verified.

        Implementations MAY extend this object with additional properties to control
        verification behavior. Common extensions may include options to disable 
        verification of contained credentials (e.g., for debugging or when only 
        presentation-level verification is needed); fine-grained controls for 
        verification of credential aspects such as status checks, validity period 
        validation, proof verification, and schema validation; and selective 
        verification controls for specific credentials within the presentation.
        
        The API is compositional when credential verification is disabled or limited;
        indvidual credentials can be verified separately using the /credentials/verify endpoint.
      
      properties:
        challenge:
          type: string
          description: A challenge provided by the requesting party of the proof; for example, <code>6e62f66e-67de-11eb-b490-ef3eeefa55f2</code>.
        domain:
          type: string
          description: The intended domain of validity for the proof; for example, <code>website.example</code>.
        returnPresentation:
          type: boolean
          description: Whether or not to return the verified presentation. If true, then the verified presentation MUST be returned. If false or not provided, then the verified presentation MUST NOT be returned.
      example:
        {
          "domain": "example.com",
          "challenge": "d436f0c8-fbd9-4e48-bbb2-55fc5d0920a8",
          "returnPresentation": true
        }
